## 👤 YOUR 3 MANUAL STEPS (10 minutes total):

### **STEP 1: Verify Vercel Account (3 minutes)**

**Run this command:**
```bash
cd /home/jonny/clawd/content-studio/landing-page
vercel login
```

**What happens:**
1. Vercel will show you a URL: `https://vercel.com/oauth/device?user_code=XXXXX`
2. Click that link or press [ENTER] to open browser
3. Sign up with GitHub or Google (recommended)
4. **CHECK YOUR EMAIL** - Vercel sends a verification link
5. Click the verification link in your email
6. Come back to terminal - it will say "Authenticated!"

**⏸️ PAUSE HERE and tell me when you're verified!**

### **STEP 2: Deploy Landing Page (2 minutes)**

**Once you're verified, run:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

**What happens:**
- I'll walk you through setup questions
- Click "Continue" to use default project name
- Click "Link to existing project" (if asked)
- Wait 30-60 seconds for deployment
- Vercel will give you a URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

**✅ Your landing page is now LIVE!**

### **STEP 3: Set Up Stripe (5 minutes)**

**I'll create Stripe products for you:**

3. Create 3 products:
   - **Fast Start:** $97 (one-time)
   - **Growth:** $297 (one-time)
